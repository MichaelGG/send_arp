A simple tool to send ARP replies in Windows. Requires WinPcap to be installed. To build, expects the WinPcap dev pack to be at ..\WdpPack.

Run without arguments to print out available devices.

Usage: send_arp <device> <src mac> <dst mac> <sender mac> <target mac> <sender ip> <target ip>

For example, to send a gratuitious ARP for 192.168.1.3 at address aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:

send_arp \Device\NPF_{guid} aabbccddeeff ffffffffffff aabbccddeeff aabbccddeeff 192.168.1.3 192.168.1.3
